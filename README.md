# MNIST

My implementation of the MNIST problem, in Java, based off Part 1 of "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid.
Achieves 97.75% accuracy using the feedforward/backpropogation algorithm described in the book. Weights are initialized according to Java's built-in Gaussian Distribution (std. set to -0.5), 5 epochs, LR = 0.2. Constants can be modified in Driver.java.
